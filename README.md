Instant voice note taker — a simple web app to capture quick voice notes in the browser, play them back, download them, and prepare for future transcription (server/AI integration).

Features
- Record audio directly in the browser using the MediaRecorder API
- Save, list, play, and download voice notes
- Minimal React + Vite starter ready for extension (transcription, tags, cloud sync)

Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   - npm install
2. Run dev server:
   - npm run dev
3. Open your browser at the address printed by Vite.

Roadmap ideas
- Add client-side transcription using Web Speech API (where available)
- Add server-side Whisper/AI transcription and indexing
- Add user accounts and cloud sync
- Add tags, search, and export options
